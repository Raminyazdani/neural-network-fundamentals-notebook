Apply outlier generation to linearly separable dataset for impact analysis.

Implementation:
1. Generate linearly separable data
2. Apply add_outliers() to create 10 mislabeled points (5% of 200 total)
3. Visualize noisy dataset showing flipped labels
4. Prepare for training SVM on noisy data

The visualization clearly shows the outliers - points that appear in the "wrong"
cluster based on their color. These mislabeled points will challenge the
classifier to find a robust decision boundary.

Next step will train Linear SVM on this noisy data and analyze the impact.

Verified: Outlier dataset generated and visualized successfully.
