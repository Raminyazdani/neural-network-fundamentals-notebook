Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(viz): fix matplotlib import statement (HOTFIX)

Fix matplotlib import error discovered during testing.

**FIXED:** Corrected import from wrong path to standard convention:
  Before: from matplotlib import plot
  After:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This hotfix resolves the AttributeError that would occur when calling plt
functions. The standard matplotlib convention is to import pyplot as plt, which
provides access to the MATLAB-style plotting interface.

All visualization code now works correctly with proper imports. This quick fix
demonstrates the typical development workflow of catching and immediately
resolving import errors.

Verified: Import error resolved, visualization function works as expected.
