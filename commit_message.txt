Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | WIP(deps): attempt to add PyTorch dependency with typo (OOPS)

Attempt to add PyTorch dependency for future work - CONTAINS TYPO.

**BUG INTRODUCED:** Added line to requirements.txt:
  toch>=2.0.0

Should be:
  torch>=2.0.0

This typo (missing 'r') will cause pip install to fail with error:
  "No matching distribution found for toch"

This is a realistic mistake when quickly editing dependency files. The typo will
be caught when attempting to install dependencies and fixed in subsequent commits.

Status: Bug present, pip install will fail.
