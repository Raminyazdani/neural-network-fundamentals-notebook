Train Linear SVM on noisy data and analyze performance degradation from outliers.

Analysis:
1. Train Linear SVM on outlier-contaminated dataset
2. Calculate accuracy (lower than clean data: ~90% vs ~99%)
3. Document accuracy degradation quantitatively
4. Analyze how outliers affect model performance

Results show Linear SVM is moderately robust to small amounts of label noise
(5% outliers) but does show measurable performance degradation. The regularization
in SVM helps maintain reasonable performance despite noise.

This analysis demonstrates importance of data quality and understanding how
classifiers handle noisy real-world data.

Verified: Accuracy drops on noisy data as expected, demonstrating outlier impact.
