Complete overhaul of README.md to portfolio-grade professional documentation.

Major additions and improvements:

3. Repository structure diagram
4. Step-by-step setup instructions (both pip and conda)
5. Clear usage instructions with expected runtime
6. Data/inputs section explaining synthetic data generation
7. Outputs section describing what the notebook produces
8. Key concepts demonstrated
