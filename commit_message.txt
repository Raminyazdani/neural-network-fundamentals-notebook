Extend SVM implementation with additional validation and testing code.

Added validation steps:
- Verify model training completed successfully
- Check that accuracy is within expected range
- Add assertions to catch unexpected behavior
- Document expected performance characteristics

This intermediate step adds robustness checking to ensure the SVM implementation
is working correctly. Validation code helps catch issues early in development
and provides quality assurance for the classification pipeline.

Verified: All validation checks pass, model performs as expected.
