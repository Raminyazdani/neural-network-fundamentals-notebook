Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(viz): implement decision boundary visualization function

Implement comprehensive function to visualize SVM decision boundaries.

Added plot_decision_boundary() function with features:
- Creates dense 2D meshgrid covering data space
- Predicts class for each point in meshgrid using trained model
- Plots filled contour showing decision regions
- Overlays scatter plot of actual data points
- Adds labels, legend, colorbar, and grid

The meshgrid approach provides smooth visualization of the decision boundary by
densely sampling the 2D space. This is the standard technique for visualizing
binary classification boundaries in 2D feature space.

Implementation uses efficient numpy broadcasting for performance on large grids.

Verified: Function generates clear visualizations showing decision boundaries and data points.
