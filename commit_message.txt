Generate visualization showing RBF kernel's non-linear decision boundary on XOR.

Visualization shows:
- 4 XOR points: (0,0)→red, (0,1)→blue, (1,0)→blue, (1,1)→red
- Complex non-linear decision boundary separating classes
- Circular/curved boundary regions around each point
- Perfect classification of all points

The visualization dramatically illustrates the difference between linear and
non-linear classifiers. Where linear SVM failed, RBF kernel creates curved
boundaries that perfectly capture the XOR pattern.

This provides powerful visual proof of kernel methods' capability for non-linear
problems.

Verified: Visualization clearly shows non-linear boundary successfully solving XOR.
