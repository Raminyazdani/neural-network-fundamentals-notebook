Test plot_decision_boundary() function with sample data and trained model.

Added test code:
- Generate small test dataset
- Train a quick SVM model
- Call plot_decision_boundary() to verify output
- Validate that visualization renders correctly

This testing step ensures the visualization function works before using it in
the main analysis. Testing with simple data helps catch any issues with the
meshgrid generation or plotting logic.

Verified: Visualization renders successfully, boundary is clearly visible.
