Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(init): initial repository setup and structure

Set up the foundational structure for the neural network fundamentals project.

This commit establishes the project repository with essential configuration files:
- README.md providing project overview and basic instructions
- requirements.txt specifying core dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, jupyter)
- .gitignore for Python project standards

The setup provides a clean starting point for implementing neural network concepts
and experiments. Dependencies are minimal and focused on scientific computing and
visualization needs.

Verified: Repository structure is clean and ready for development.
