Implement visualize_data() function for scatter plotting - CONTAINS BUG.

Added visualization function with scatter plot implementation:
- Creates figure and axis
- Plots points colored by class label
- Adds labels, legend, and grid
- Supports custom titles

**BUG INTRODUCED:** Used incorrect matplotlib import statement:
  from matplotlib import plot

Should be:
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This is a common mistake when quickly implementing visualization code. The
function logic is correct but will fail at runtime due to the wrong import
path. This will be caught and fixed in the next commit.

Status: Bug present, needs immediate fix.
