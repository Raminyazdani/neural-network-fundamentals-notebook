Add scikit-learn for SVM classification and import LinearSVC.

Changes:
1. Updated requirements.txt to include scikit-learn>=1.0.0
2. Added "## Linear SVM Classification" section to notebook
3. Imported LinearSVC: from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC

This prepares the environment for implementing Support Vector Machine classification.
LinearSVC provides an efficient linear SVM implementation suitable for linearly
separable data. The dependency addition is minimal and focused on classification
needs.

Next step will implement the actual SVM training pipeline.

Verified: scikit-learn installs successfully and LinearSVC imports without errors.
