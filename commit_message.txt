Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(data): add XOR dataset generation

Implement XOR dataset generation for non-linear classification demonstrations.

Added generate_xor_data() function that creates the classic XOR problem:
- 4 points representing XOR logic: (0,0)→0, (0,1)→1, (1,0)→1, (1,1)→0
- Returns numpy arrays in same format as linearly separable data

The XOR dataset is a canonical example of a non-linearly separable problem that
cannot be solved by linear classifiers. This will be used to demonstrate the
limitations of linear models and the necessity of non-linear approaches.

Added comprehensive markdown documentation explaining the XOR problem and its
significance in neural network history.

Verified: XOR data structure matches expected format and values.
