Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(ml): add RBF kernel SVM for non-linear classification

Implement non-linear SVM using RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel for XOR problem.

Changes:
1. Added "## Model Optimization" section
2. Imported SVC (full SVM with kernel support) from sklearn.svm
3. Created SVC model with kernel='rbf'
4. Trained on XOR dataset

RBF kernel implicitly maps data to higher-dimensional space where XOR becomes
linearly separable. This is the "kernel trick" - achieving non-linear boundaries
without explicitly computing high-dimensional features.

Initial implementation uses default parameters (gamma='scale', C=1.0).

Verified: RBF SVM achieves much better accuracy on XOR (~100% vs ~50% for linear).
