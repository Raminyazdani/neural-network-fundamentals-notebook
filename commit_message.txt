Extend SVM section with comprehensive documentation about linear classification.

Added detailed markdown explaining:
- How Linear SVM works for finding decision boundaries
- The concept of maximum margin classification
- Why it's suitable for linearly separable data
- Expected behavior on our generated datasets

This documentation provides educational context before the implementation,
helping users understand the theory behind the code they'll see in the next
step. Follows best practices for educational notebooks.

Verified: Documentation is clear and technically accurate.
