Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | WIP(analysis): test outlier generation function with validation

Test add_outliers() function to verify correct behavior before main usage.

Testing includes:
- Generate clean dataset
- Add known number of outliers
- Verify exact number of label flips occurred
- Check that outliers are distributed randomly
- Validate data structure remains valid

Testing confirms the outlier generation works as expected and introduces the
desired level of label noise. The function maintains data integrity while
creating realistic noisy scenarios.

Ready to proceed with robustness analysis using outlier datasets.

Verified: Outlier function works correctly, creates expected label noise.
