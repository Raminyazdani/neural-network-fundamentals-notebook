Implement function to generate two linearly separable 2D clusters using NumPy.

The generate_linearly_separable_data() function creates two Gaussian-distributed
clusters that can be separated by a linear decision boundary. Parameters include:
- n_samples: number of points per cluster (default 100)
- separation: distance between cluster centers (default 2.0)

Implementation uses np.random.seed(42) for reproducibility. Each cluster is
generated with unit variance Gaussian noise around its center point, with centers
positioned at (+separation, +separation) and (-separation, -separation).

This provides the foundation for demonstrating linear classification algorithms.

Verified: Function generates expected data shapes and distributions.
