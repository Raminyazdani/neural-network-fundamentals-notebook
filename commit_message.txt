Add initial testing and validation for RBF kernel SVM on XOR problem.

Test implementation:
- Verify RBF model trains without errors
- Check that accuracy dramatically improves over linear SVM
- Validate that all 4 XOR points are classified correctly
- Confirm model convergence

Results confirm RBF kernel successfully solves XOR problem that linear SVM
couldn't handle. This demonstrates the power of kernel methods for non-linear
classification tasks.

Next step will tune parameters and add visualization.

Verified: RBF SVM achieves perfect classification on XOR dataset.
