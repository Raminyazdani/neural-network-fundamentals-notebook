Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(ml): implement Linear SVM training pipeline

Implement complete Linear SVM classification pipeline for linearly separable data.

Implementation includes:
1. Generate linearly separable data using generate_linearly_separable_data()
2. Visualize the data using visualize_data()
3. Create and train LinearSVC model with default parameters
4. Fit model on generated data
5. Calculate and display training accuracy

The pipeline demonstrates the full workflow from data generation through training
to evaluation. Linear SVM performs well on linearly separable data, typically
achieving high accuracy (>95%) due to the clean separation between clusters.

This establishes the baseline for comparing with non-linear classification later.

Verified: SVM trains successfully and achieves expected high accuracy on linearly separable data.
