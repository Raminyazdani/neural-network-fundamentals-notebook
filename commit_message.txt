Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(portfolio): final portfolio refinement and cleanup

Final polish to make repository portfolio-ready with all academic traces removed.

Comprehensive cleanup:
1. Removed all assignment/academic language from notebook
2. Converted exercise instructions to professional documentation
3. Removed student identification information
4. Ensured professional naming throughout (neural_network_fundamentals.ipynb)
5. Verified all markdown cells use professional tone
6. Confirmed requirements.txt contains only necessary dependencies
7. Validated README is comprehensive and portfolio-grade
8. Ensured .gitignore covers appropriate files

The repository now presents as a professional portfolio project demonstrating
fundamental neural network concepts through clean, educational implementation.
All content is suitable for public portfolio display with no academic artifacts
remaining.

Final state:
- 19 cells (10 markdown, 9 code)
- Professional presentation throughout
- Complete documentation
- Runnable and reproducible

Verified: Repository is fully portfolio-ready and matches intended final state.
