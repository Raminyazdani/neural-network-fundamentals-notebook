Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | WIP(data): add scaffold for linearly separable data generation

Create initial notebook structure with title and documentation section.

Added the first two cells to neural_network_fundamentals.ipynb:
- Title cell with project name
- Section header describing linearly separable data generation approach

This scaffold establishes the notebook's structure and provides documentation
for the data generation functionality that will be implemented in the next step.
The approach follows educational best practices by documenting intent before
implementation.

Verified: Notebook is valid JSON and opens in Jupyter successfully.
