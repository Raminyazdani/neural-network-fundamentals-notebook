Apply decision boundary visualization to Linear SVM on linearly separable data.

Generated visualization showing:
- Two clearly separated clusters (red and blue points)
- Linear decision boundary cleanly separating the classes
- Decision regions colored by predicted class
- High confidence regions far from boundary

The visualization demonstrates that Linear SVM successfully finds an optimal
linear separator for linearly separable data. The boundary maximizes the margin
between classes, characteristic of SVM optimization.

This provides baseline visualization for comparing with non-linear problems.

Verified: Visualization clearly shows successful linear classification with clean separation.
