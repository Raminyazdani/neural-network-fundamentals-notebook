Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(docs): add comprehensive analysis of linear vs non-linear classification

Document key observations and insights from linear vs non-linear classification experiments.

Analysis covers:
1. Linear separability concept and when linear models work
2. Why XOR is non-linearly separable and how to recognize such problems
3. How RBF kernel enables non-linear classification via kernel trick
4. Comparison of Linear SVM vs RBF SVM performance on different datasets
5. Practical implications for choosing classification algorithms

Added sections:
- "## Observations: Linear vs Non-Linear Classification"
- "## Decision Boundary Uniqueness"

Documentation provides educational context tying together all experiments,
helping users understand fundamental concepts in classification and when to
apply different approaches.

Verified: Analysis is technically accurate and provides clear insights.
