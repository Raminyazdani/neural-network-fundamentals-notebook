Demonstrate Linear SVM limitations by applying to XOR (non-linearly separable) dataset.

Implementation:
1. Generate XOR data using generate_xor_data()
2. Visualize the XOR points showing the non-linear structure
3. Train Linear SVM on XOR data
4. Calculate accuracy (expected to be ~50% - random chance)
5. Visualize decision boundary showing poor fit

Results show Linear SVM fundamentally cannot solve XOR problem because no linear
boundary can separate the classes. The model achieves approximately random
accuracy, demonstrating the critical limitation of linear classifiers on
non-linearly separable data.

This motivates the need for non-linear approaches (kernel methods, neural networks).

Verified: Linear SVM fails on XOR as expected, achieving ~50% accuracy.
