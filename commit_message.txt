Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | WIP(viz): add visualization section scaffold

Create scaffold for data visualization functionality.

Added markdown section "## Data Visualization" with documentation describing
the visualization approach for displaying 2D data points with color-coded labels.

This preparation step establishes the structure before implementing the
visualization function. Following the pattern of documentation-first development
to maintain clear notebook organization.

Next step will implement the actual plotting function.

Verified: Notebook structure remains valid and well-organized.
