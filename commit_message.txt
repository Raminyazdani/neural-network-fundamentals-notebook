Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | WIP(deps): attempt to fix dependency typo (still incomplete)

Attempt to fix the dependency typo but leave issue partially unresolved.

Changed:
  toch>=2.0.0

To:
  torch>=2.0.0

However, upon reflection, torch is not actually needed for this notebook which
only uses scikit-learn for classification. The dependency should be removed
entirely rather than just fixing the typo.

This intermediate step shows realistic development where a partial fix is applied
before realizing the deeper issue. Next commit will properly resolve by removing
the unnecessary dependency.

Status: Typo fixed but dependency still unnecessary.
