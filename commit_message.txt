Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | WIP(docs): add analysis and observations about XOR experiment

Add detailed analysis explaining why Linear SVM fails on XOR problem.

Documentation added:
- Explanation of non-linear separability concept
- Why XOR is the canonical example of non-linearly separable data
- Mathematical perspective on linear boundaries
- Connection to neural network history (Minsky & Papert)

This analysis provides educational context helping users understand the
fundamental limitation discovered in the experiment. The XOR problem historically
motivated the development of multi-layer neural networks.

Verified: Analysis is technically accurate and pedagogically sound.
