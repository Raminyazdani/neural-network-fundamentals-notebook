Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-fundamentals-notebook | main | feat(viz): visualize decision boundary with outliers

Generate visualization showing how outliers affect the SVM decision boundary.

Visualization shows:
- Data points colored by their (possibly incorrect) labels
- Decision boundary influenced by outlier points
- Boundary shifts compared to clean data version
- Some outliers on wrong side of boundary

The visualization reveals how the SVM's decision boundary adapts to accommodate
the mislabeled points. The boundary is "pulled" toward outliers, attempting to
classify them correctly, which can negatively impact the overall model.

This provides intuitive visual understanding of how label noise affects learned
decision boundaries.

Verified: Visualization clearly shows outlier impact on decision boundary.
